# image-classifier-neural-network
A PyTorch-based handwritten digit classifier trained on the MNIST dataset. Uses a simple feedforward neural network (784 → 16 → 16 → 10) with ReLU activations and Adam optimizer. Includes training, testing, accuracy evaluation, model saving/loading, and visualization of predictions with Matplotlib.
